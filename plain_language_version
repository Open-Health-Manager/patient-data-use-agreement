1. Collecting Health Information.
•	App will collect and display to you the personal health data it receives from your health care providers. 
•	App can only receive your personal health information if you tell your health care providers that you want your information sent to App. App will help you ask your providers to do this if you need help.
•	Your providers have to send your health information to App if you ask. You may have to follow different instructions from different providers so that they are sure that you want your information to be sent to App. This is to protect your privacy.
•	If your providers have the technology to do so, you can ask them to send updated health information to App regularly, as soon as information changes or is updated. [Include link to authorization/standing data release here]
