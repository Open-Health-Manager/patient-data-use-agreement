This repository contains the current draft of the Patient Data Use Agreement (PDUA) for data stored within the [Patient Data Manager](https://github.com/patient-data-manager/pdm-ios).

It is intended to establish a relationship between an individual and a data management service entity for the purposes of managing the individual’s complete, longitudinal health data on the individual’s behalf and provides complete control over the aggregated copy of the patient’s data to the patient.
