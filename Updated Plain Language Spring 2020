I __________________ [my first and last name] want to use the services of Company / Organization (Company) _________________ to collect and manage my personal health information. This requires me and Company to agree on each other’s rights and responsibilities related to the collection and management of my personal health information. In some cases, I can choose how I want to handle certain things like sharing my data. My agreements with Company and my decisions are documented here.

1. 	Collecting Health Information.
•	Company will collect and display to me the personal health data it receives from my health care providers for my informational purposes only. I understand that Company is not providing medical diagnosis, treatment, or advice unless it specifically states that it does (for example, telemedicine). 
•	Company can only receive my personal health information if I tell my health care providers to send it to Company. Company can help me ask my providers to do this.
•	My providers must send my health information to Company if I ask. I understand that I may have to follow different instructions from each provider so each provider may be sure that I want my information sent to Company. This protects my privacy.
•	I can ask my providers if they have the technology to send my health information to Company as soon as it changes or is updated. [Include link to authorization/standing data release here]

2. 	Collecting Other Information.
•	Company can collect and display other information, such as from a health tracker, my contact information, or my grocery receipts. This information can give me a better understanding of my health and wellness. I can choose what other information Company collects and displays here: [Add link]. 
•	I understand that Company may need to collect at least one way to contact me and keep my account running, such as an email address, and may also need to collect my billing information if I am paying Company for the service. I understand that collection of information to do these things is necessary and may not be turned off.
•	Company will explain all of the information it collects from me and why. 

3. 	Ownership of All Information Collected by Company. 
•	The information collected by Company belongs to me. 
•	I can add notes to or ask questions about my information. 
o	Adding notes to my held information in Company’s service does not add notes to my information anywhere else.  
o	Company will keep track of my notes so a provider looking at information collected by Company will understand the difference between my notes and what came from a healthcare provider.
o	If I need to correct my health record at a health care provider, I must follow my provider’s process to make changes.
o	If Company is not the source of the health or other information but is only collecting it for me, Company may not have the answers to questions I ask about my information, and I understand that I may need to contact other people or companies for answers to my questions.
•	I can delete my information or parts of my information at any time. Company may not keep a backup copy so I must be sure I want to delete the information. Deletions are permanent.

•	No one, including Company, can do anything with my information or see it without my permission.

4. 	Sharing Information

•	Some services that collect patient data use pieces of patient information in research. This is often called deidentified, aggregated data. Company will ask me if I want to allow use of my information for these purposes. Company might offer to share with me some of the money it earns from using my information. There is a risk that my information could be compared to other information and I could be identified later. I can say yes or no to this type of use here: [If Company does this, insert line that says “To learn more about this, click here”].
